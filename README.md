This is the repository for automation of Roboshop project

## I will be giving names based on the components

## Few basic commands which are used during this journey

1) git clone repository       :   Downloads the whole repository
2) git pull                   :   Downloads only the change
3) git add filename           :   Git will start tracking the changes make on the file with name filename
4) git add .                  :   Git will start tracking all the changes
5) git commit -m "msg name"   :   Adding msg to the commit / changes that we made
6) git push                   :   The changes will be pushed to the repository

## Everytime we have to ensure that we are inside the repository to execute git commands
## We will perform clone once and pull multiple times
